SIH1279,Development of software for streamlining the listing of cases through Differentiated Case Flow Management,"Cases differ substantially in the time required for a fair and timely adjudication, not all cases make the same demands upon judicial system resources. thus, they need not be subject to the same processing requirements. the concept of case flow management for high court and subordinate courts was first introduced through the judgment of the supreme court of india in the case of salem advocate bar association v. union of india, following which the model draft rules were proposed by the law commission, jagannadha rao committee, wherein model case management rules endorsed by the supreme court also containing timelines for different case types, the upper limit of which is two years were proposed. problem statement/challenge: computerization has failed to improve the case scheduling process. however, solving some administrative problems through the aid of technology could reduce the constraints under which judges work and ensure the timely listing of cases thus aiding the speedy disposal of cases. a 'differentiated case flow management(dcm) system would enable a court to prioritize cases and the recognition that many cases can and should proceed through the court system at a faster pace than others if appropriate pathways are provided. objective/expected outcome: under a dcm system, cases do not wait for disposition simply on the basis of the chronological order of their filing. this would greatly aid in minimizing and making more predictable the time between case events more and aid efficient disposal of cases",cases differ substantially time required fair timely adjudication cases make demands upon judicial system resources thus need subject processing requirements concept case flow management high court subordinate courts first introduced judgment supreme court india case salem advocate bar association v union india following model draft rules proposed law commission jagannadha rao committee wherein model case management rules endorsed supreme court also containing timelines different case types upper limit two years proposed problem statementchallenge computerization failed improve case scheduling process however solving administrative problems aid technology could reduce constraints judges work ensure timely listing cases thus aiding speedy disposal cases differentiated case flow managementdcm system would enable court prioritize cases recognition many cases proceed court system faster pace others appropriate pathways provided objectiveexpected outcome dcm system cases wait disposition simply basis chronological order filing would greatly aid minimizing making predictable time case events aid efficient disposal cases,"['case', 'differ', 'substantially', 'time', 'require', 'fair', 'timely', 'adjudication', 'case', 'demand', 'judicial', 'system', 'resource', 'need', 'subject', 'processing', 'requirement', 'concept', 'case', 'flow', 'management', 'high', 'court', 'subordinate', 'court', 'introduce', 'judgment', 'supreme', 'court', 'india', 'case', 'salem', 'advocate', 'bar', 'association', 'v', 'union', 'india', 'follow', 'model', 'draft', 'rule', 'propose', 'law', 'commission', 'jagannadha', 'rao', 'committee', 'model', 'case', 'management', 'rule', 'endorse', 'supreme', 'court', 'contain', 'timeline', 'different', 'case', 'type', 'upper', 'limit', 'year', 'propose', 'problem', 'statementchallenge', 'computerization', 'fail', 'improve', 'case', 'scheduling', 'process', 'solve', 'administrative', 'problem', 'aid', 'technology', 'reduce', 'constraint', 'judge', 'work', 'ensure', 'timely', 'list', 'case', 'aid', 'speedy', 'disposal', 'case', 'differentiate', 'case', 'flow', 'managementdcm', 'system', 'enable', 'court', 'prioritize', 'case', 'recognition', 'case', 'proceed', 'court', 'system', 'fast', 'pace', 'appropriate', 'pathway', 'provide', 'objectiveexpecte', 'outcome', 'dcm', 'system', 'case', 'wait', 'disposition', 'simply', 'basis', 'chronological', 'order', 'filing', 'greatly', 'aid', 'minimize', 'make', 'predictable', 'time', 'case', 'event', 'aid', 'efficient', 'disposal', 'case']"

SIH1293,"Automatic regulation of valves for release of water based upon soil moisture availability in the root zone of the crop, using artificial intelligence, in a piped and micro irrigation network of irrigation system.","In modern agricultural practices, efficient water management plays a critical role in achieving optimal crop yields, conserving water resources, and maintaining ecological balance. however, existing irrigation systems often lack the precision required to deliver water tailored to the actual needs of crops, leading to water wastage, suboptimal plant growth, and environmental degradation. this problem is particularly pronounced in piped and micro irrigation networks, where traditional methods of manual control fail to adapt dynamically to varying soil moisture conditions within the root zone of crops. the core issue lies in the absence of an automated mechanism that can regulate the release of water based on real-time soil moisture availability. the inconsistency in water distribution and the inability to synchronize irrigation with crop water requirements result in detrimental outcomes for both the agricultural yield and water conservation efforts. to address this problem, there is a compelling need for an innovative solution that leverages artificial intelligence (ai) to enable the automatic regulation of valves for water release in piped and micro irrigation networks. by incorporating ai-powered soil moisture monitoring and decision-making processes, this solution aims to bridge the gap between water supply and crop demand, while also optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact. key challenges: dynamic water demand: crops have varying water requirements influenced by factors such as growth stage, weather conditions, and plant type. developing an ai system capable of accurately predicting these dynamic water demands is a complex challenge. real-time data integration: integrating real-time soil moisture data from multiple sensors across a field into a centralized ai system requires robust data collection, transmission, and processing mechanisms. algorithm precision: designing ai algorithms that can effectively analyze soil moisture data, historical trends, and other relevant parameters to make accurate decisions about water release timing and quantities. valve control mechanism: developing an automated valve control mechanism that can respond swiftly and accurately to the ai's recommendations while considering the physical characteristics of the piped and micro irrigation network. adaptability: ensuring that the ai system can adapt to changing environmental conditions, crop types, and variations in soil properties over time. user-friendly interface: designing a user-friendly interface that allows farmers and irrigation managers to monitor and intervene in the system as needed, while also trusting in the ai's autonomous decisions. economic viability:

SIH1294,Estimation of inflow to a reservoir from the rainfall considering soil moisture in its catchment and releases from upstream reservoirs and automatically opening of reservoir gates for moderately releasing the water to avoid the flooding in a basin.,"Effective management of water resources in reservoirs is a crucial aspect of mitigating flooding, ensuring water availability, and maintaining ecological balance in a basin. the challenge lies in accurately estimating the inflow to a reservoir, taking into account various factors such as rainfall, soil moisture conditions within the reservoir's catchment area, and upstream reservoir releases. the subsequent task of managing reservoir gates to release water in a controlled manner to prevent flooding adds another layer of complexity. the existing methodologies for reservoir management often rely on manual intervention or simplistic models that may not capture the intricacies of changing environmental conditions. as a result, basins are vulnerable to both overflows and insufficient water supply during critical periods. to address this issue, there is a pressing need for an innovative solution that integrates data-driven approaches and automation to optimize reservoir gate operations and mitigate flood risks. key challenges: accurate inflow estimation: developing a robust and accurate method to estimate the inflow to a reservoir by considering multiple parameters, including rainfall intensity, soil moisture conditions within the catchment area, and potential contributions from upstream reservoir releases. real-time data integration: integrating real-time data from weather forecasts, soil moisture sensors, and upstream reservoir releases into a centralized system for inflow estimation and decision-making. model complexity: designing sophisticated models that can effectively capture the complex interactions between rainfall, soil moisture, reservoir levels, and inflow dynamics, while remaining computationally feasible. optimal gate control: developing an automated gate control mechanism that can regulate the release of water from the reservoir in a manner that prevents flooding downstream while ensuring optimal utilization of the stored water. flood risk assessment: incorporating flood risk assessment models that consider downstream vulnerability, historical flood patterns, and potential impacts of various release strategies. adaptive decision-making: creating algorithms that can adapt to changing conditions, such as sudden heavy rainfall events or unexpected reservoir releases from upstream, to make timely and accurate decisions. communication and coordination: ensuring effective communication and coordination among various stakeholders, including reservoir managers, weather forecast providers, and upstream reservoir operators. balancing water needs: striking a balance between releasing enough water to prevent flooding while also maintaining a sufficient reservoir volume for future water supply and downstream water needs. the proposed solution seeks to tackle these challenges by employing advanced data analytics, machine learning, and automation technologies. by creating an integrated system that leverages real-time data and predictive models, the solution aims to optimize reservoir gate operations to prevent flooding while optimizing water utilization. this would lead to enhanced flood resilience, improved water management, and increased ecological sustainability within the basin",effective management water resources reservoirs crucial

hazardous locations which contain potential risk to damage and destroy human life, property, and environment on a huge sale. this software should be able to find out the area or more precisely the threat zone in which the radiations and blast waves of an explosion will spread to damage its surrounding locality. it's been observed in many explosions and fires in industries, say according to the official report of jaipur iocl fire' by 'sk roy, gm (ise), co indian oil corporation limited, held on 29 october 2009, where the fire following an explosion in a tank caused 9 tanks out of 11 to explode drastically after the first explosion and the fire continues to spread it's havoc for a sum total of 11 days and no fire personnel, experts and fire services could suggest ways to put off the fire and the fire extinguished by itself after the crude oil(fuel in the tanks on fire) gets totally burned. according to this report, later mb lal committee provided 118 recommendations for oil installations but the fighting capabilities cannot be utilized if they can not be directed through the right way and direction of approach towards the fire. the above example shows that even if we have sufficient firefighting resources but if they approach the fire from the wrong direction say from a direction or zone where radiation is at its peak or from where the efficiency of firefighting will be least the available resources are of no use. one should know the zone affected by the fire and the area where the radiations will be very high, high, medium, or low i.e. areas could be distinguished according to the radiations and potential to damage the human, flora, and fauna of the locality present in that threat zone. if a fire will be tackled from the right direction it can be extinguished in a more efficient manner with the least use of resources, and the least wastage of resources, within the least time. one of the most useful advantages of such software is that it can be used to evacuate people and animals from areas with disastrous exposure to radiation so that more and more lives can be saved until the fire will be extinguished or under control. so, such software should be made and propagated among fire personnel for its more efficient and convenient use for different eases and zones for different types of storage i.e different threat zones for different types of storage like lpg bullets, horton spheres storing the same volume of lpg with different wind speed and wind directions will have different affected areas under radiations. development of such

SIH1334,Software for intervention of speech sound disorders in Hindi and English.,"Background: the majority of individuals with intellectual disability, hearing impairment, cerebral palsy, chronic neurological condition, and speech and language disability present with speech sound disorders characterized by unintelligible speech. these errors may reflect a lack of motor skills to produce a sound, a lack of linguistic knowledge, or deficiencies in both. the intervention approaches must focus on one or a combination of both skills. hindi, the national language of india is spoken by over 1 million people, and 43% of the indian population. though several training resources are available in english, the resources in indian languages are limited. a training resource manual titled ãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã‹å“phonics and phonological processing to develop literacy and articulation-preliteracy and articulation drill bookãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã¢â€žâ¢ contains the sounds of hindi in isolation and in different words across all word positions. the same can be used to develop software for training individuals in perception and production intervention. given that the majority of the indian population is in the rural regions and human resources are in the urban regions, this software can help bridge the gap and serve the un-served population. the software can be used to give visual and auditory stimulation and feedback and can help track progress. the training can be more intense with short frequent sessions, and flexible timings. ãƒâ€šã‚â· detailed description: motor-based intervention generally includes perceptual and production training and both can be incorporated into the same software. perceptual training also called ear training involves teaching their clients to perceive the distinction between the target and error sounds. through software, the child can be presented with a variety of correct and incorrect real-speech examples of the target phoneme and can be asked to make judgments about whether the production was correct. the software can also provide visual feedback about the accuracy of the childãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã¢â€žâ¢s judgment. the software can also track the childãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã¢â€žâ¢s success rate to assist the clinician in monitoring progress. production of a target sound can be done using imitation, phonetic placement, successive approximation (shaping), and contextual utilization. all of these can be achieved using the software specifically developed for its use. for eg: imitation: several auditory models of the sound in isolation, syllables, or words can be provided. the child can be asked to watch and listen to the video that shows the 3- dimensional image of the sound /word being produced and then can be asked to repeat the same. the clientãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã¢â€žâ¢s production can also be recorded for self-feedback. phonetic placement when the client is unable to imitate a target sound, cues or instructions regarding where to place his or her articulators can be provided. use of camera to serve as a mirror, images showing the placement, and videos showing the placement and movement during articulation can be developed. the videos would be 3 dimensional and could involve sound in isolation and word level. contextual utilization involves isolating a target sound from a particular phonetic context in which a client may happen to produce a sound correctly, even though he or she typically produces the sound in error. eg: the child can say ãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã‹å“bright sunãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã¢â€žâ¢, but cannot produceãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã‹å“sãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã¢â€žâ¢ in other context. slowly introduce other context through the software and then progress to production ofãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã‹å“sãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã¢â€žâ¢ in isolation. ãƒâ€šã‚â· description of the solution: for instance, the child needs to be taught the pronunciation of the syllable /ka/. 1. the word ãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã‹å“catãƒâ¢ã¢â€šâ¬ã¢â€žâ¢ is projected along with the picture. 2. as we tap the word, /kãƒæ’ã‚â¦t/ is heard. this forms the auditory cue. 3. the placement of the tongue in the oral cavity and as its changes when the syllables /ka/ /ãƒæ’ã‚â¦/ and /t/ are pronounced is presented on the animation. this provides a visual cue. 4. production of isolated syllables eg. /ka/ in this case, can also be shown. 5. the tongue movements inside the oral cavity can be shown in slow motion as well. a total of 2-13 such words for each phoneme(depending on the frequency of occurrence of phoneme in the language) , with each word having a maximum of 5 syllables can be shown to explain the articulatory pattern. the software can be developed in both indian english and in hindi, based on the data set",background majority individuals intellectual disability hearing

digitized forms. but for an ayurvedic student or practitioner, exploring this multitude of literature for identifying their """"drug of choice' often becomes tedious and impractical. here is the need of a custom software that can identify the apt formulation that has been designed to treat a constellation of symptoms and present it to the student/practitioner along with its reference and other desired properties. for example, the two formulations punarnavadi kashaya and vyaghryadi kashaya are mentioned in texts as follows: both these are decoctions advised in jvara (fever) and kasa (cough).

the body. i punarnavadi would be the appropriate choice. the objective of the proposed software is to identify the single drugs and formulations that suit a set of symptoms. certain ingredients (eg. jaggery) are unsuitable for certain categories of patients (e.g. diabetics). there are also medicine mediums that are unsuitable for specific diseases (e.g. fermented/alcoholic preparations in diabetes). such information is also expected to be conveyed to the learner or practitioner who uses the software. the same disease has been mentioned in different names (e.g. jvara and santapa for fever) and the same word has been used to denote different (eg. abhaya generally means terminalia chebula but in the context of jatyadi ghrita, it means vetiveria zizanioides. the multiple names of same diseases are expected to be included in the tags of each formulation. the sources for the formulations, and synonyms and similar words have been included in the data section. it is also desirable

reactive in nature, i.e., they are pressed into action only after the occurrence of a mishap. the objective of the problem statement is to develop predictive analytic models to prevent mishaps even before they occur. the second issue pertaining to women's safety is the lack of manpower for proactive interventions to prevent mishaps. another objective is to develop, monitor, predict, and provide actionable intelligence for the prevention of mishaps. the solution can explore the contours of anonymous and non-anonymous data collection mechanisms, point-to-point reporting systems, and predictive data analytics for providing actionable intelligence. further, the collected data can be leveraged to develop and mark probable black spots and red time zones for pin-pointed actions to be taken by administrators. to promote a community-based system, the system may be designed in such a way that it not only gathers information from students but also involves the entire student community in the prevention of mishaps. the data collected from the participants can be populated into the system, and real-time monitoring can be done with an interactive dashboard and charts. it can also be used to develop real-time rapid intervention by the student community, college administration, and local authorities. further to this, a companion model can also be developed for students that helps them

SIH1441,Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm,"In our organization, we encounter a significant challenge when dealing with a large volume of medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports received from numerous providers, including doctors, hospitals, and labs, as well as from customers. to streamline our processes and improve efficiency, we aim to develop a system capable of extracting and standardizing these documents at a provider level. additionally, we need to identify claims across different providers that exhibit similar document templates. the primary issue we face stems from fraudulent customers who exploit identical digital or printed templates, with minor modifications such as changing the provider names, logos, colors, and text content positioning. by manipulating the customer details within these templates, they attempt to file reimbursement claims that are difficult to detect using standard document comparison checks. to tackle this problem, we require the development of a robust similar document template matching algorithm. this algorithm will automate the process of template extraction and standardization, allowing us to identify similarities and patterns across various documents. by comparing the templates used in different claims, we can effectively identify instances of potential fraud, even when the textual content has been altered. the algorithm should be designed to handle a high volume of documents from diverse providers and customers. it should be capable of identifying commonalities in template structure, design elements, and formatting, while also accounting for variations resulting from legitimate differences between providers. key objectives of the similar document template matching algorithm: 1. template extraction: develop a mechanism to extract and standardize templates from medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports received from providers and customers. 2. template comparison: implement an algorithm to compare and identify similarities among different document templates, accounting for minor modifications and variations in content. 3. fraud detection: enhance the algorithm to flag instances of potentially fraudulent claims where similar templates are used, with modifications made to customer details while maintaining the overall structure and design. 4. scalability and efficiency: ensure the algorithm can handle a large volume of documents efficiently, considering the growing number of providers and customers we deal with. 5. flexibility: design the algorithm to accommodate variations in template design and content across different providers, while maintaining the ability to detect fraudulent patterns the successful development and implementation of the similar document template matching algorithm will significantly enhance our ability to detect fraudulent claims and improve the overall accuracy and efficiency of our document processing workflows. theme: fraud detection & document templatization evaluation criteria: the effectiveness of the similar document template matching algorithm will be evaluated based on several key criteria. the primary criterion is the accuracy of detection, which measures the algorithm's ability to identify similarities in document templates accurately and efficiently. the algorithm should be able to detect instances where fraudulent customers exploit identical templates with minor modifications, distinguishing between suspicious and fraudulent documents. to aid in the interpretation and communication of the algorithm's findings, the detected output should be represented using color-coded flags. amber flags can be used to indicate suspicious documents that exhibit similarities in template structure or design elements, while red flags should be assigned to identify documents with high potential for fraud. this visual representation will assist investigators in prioritizing their efforts and taking appropriate actions. input data set: the team will have to generate their own dataset using publicly available datasets or archives. this approach ensures that the algorithm is exposed to a wide range of document templates from various providers and customers. the dataset should encompass different document types, such as medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports, reflecting the real-world scenarios the algorithm will encounter during deployment. by using this self-generated dataset, the algorithm can be trained and evaluated under realistic conditions. this approach enables the algorithm to learn patterns and similarities that exist in actual documents, allowing it to accurately detect fraudulent claims and identify suspicious patterns across different providers and customers. teams working on this problem statement are advised to create their own dataset to build and train their algorithms",organization encounter significant challenge dealing large volume

SIH1457,Get Fit Faster with a High-Tech Tracker: Analyze Human Activity and GPS Data for Improved Results,"Description (background, detailed description, and expected solution): various fields require human action recognition (har) to function optimally. for instance, the healthcare sector needs har to monitor the activities of patients, the elderly, or people with specific needs. by doing so, it can offer prompt services and make decisions in real-time according to the requirements. similarly, the sports industry also utilizes har to track a player's performance by monitoring their movements, identifying and comparing the actions performed, and conducting automatic statistical analysis. consequently, it is essential to implement such workflows quickly and more efficiently based on specific domain requirements. an effective solution is to consider various sensor data from mobile phones, such as accelerometers and gps, and analyze such short-duration time series data. the analysis may aim

SIH1463,Establishing a Server log system for E-governance with appropriate notification and content based classification of log AICTE,"A server log system, also known as a log management system, is a software tool that records and stores log messages generated by various components and applications running on a server. it provides a centralized location for collecting, analyzing, and managing logs to monitor and troubleshoot system issues and performance problems. here are some basic requirement of a server log system: 1. log collection: the system collects log data from various sources, including operating systems, applications, services, and network devices. it can gather logs from different servers and consolidate them into a central repository. 2. log storage: log entries are typically stored in a structured format, such as plain text files or a database. the system may also employ compression and archival mechanisms to optimize storage space and retain logs for an extended period. 3. log analysis and search: the log system enables searching, filtering, and querying log data based on specific criteria, such as time range, log level, source, or custom keywords. this functionality helps in identifying patterns, anomalies, or events of interest. 4. alerting and notifications: the system can be configured to send notifications or alerts based on predefined rules or thresholds. for example, it can notify administrators when critical errors occur or security-related events are detected in the logs. 5. log visualization and reporting: the log systems provide visual representations of log data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards. visualizations will help in gaining insights, identifying trends, and generating reports for auditing, compliance, or performance analysis. 6. log retention and compliance: server logs retained for a certain period to comply with regulatory requirements or internal policies. the log system should support flexible retention periods and secure storage to meet these obligations. 7. integration and apis: a robust log system offers apis and integrations with other tools and systems. this allows developers and administrators to automate log analysis, integrate with security information and event management (siem) systems, or build custom solutions on top of the log data. so the developed software should provide the following features to the end-user; 8. server provisioning: the system facilitates the deployment and provisioning of servers, including hardware configuration, operating system installation, and initial software setup. it may include tools for automated server deployment and configuration management. 9. monitoring and performance management: server management systems monitor the health, performance, and resource utilization of servers. they collect and analyze data on cpu usage, memory usage, disk space, network traffic, and other metrics. alerts and notifications are generated when predefined thresholds are exceeded. 10. patch management and updates: the system ensures that servers are kept up to date with security patches, bug fixes, and software updates. it automates the process of identifying, downloading, testing, and applying updates to minimize vulnerabilities and improve server stability. 11. configuration management: server management systems help administrators maintain consistent configurations across servers. they provide tools for managing and enforcing server configurations, including software installations, network settings, user accounts, and security policies. 12. backup and disaster recovery: the system facilitates regular backups of server data and configurations to protect against data loss and facilitate disaster recovery. it may include features for scheduling backups, managing backup storage, and performing recovery operations in case of system failures. 13. logging and auditing: the system captures and stores logs generated by servers for troubleshooting, compliance, and auditing purposes. it provides tools for analyzing logs, searching for specific events, and generating reports on server activities. 14. resource allocation and load balancing: server management systems help optimize resource allocation and load balancing across servers. they can monitor server workloads, allocate resources based on demand, and distribute incoming network traffic efficiently",server log system also known log management system software tool records stores log messages generated various

of the physical organs or mentally unstable children are considered to be specially-abled ones and to help them absorb the natural flow of life, we need to consider and provide them with a supportive and growing environment where they are able to live and grow. in the educational ecosystem, the needs of such an environment need to be catered according to the category of ailments that exist in the students and provisions need to be made in order to make them feel special, and cared for and set the right mindset while they grow. there are very few educational institutes in india, that accept specially-abled students in regular streams making them feel one among natural children. the first and foremost need is to comply with the disability act provisions in the indian education ecosystem and have the right provisions such as physical infrastructure, digital interaction pathways and the right tooling to make this happen in a much larger portion of the indian education industry. this problem statement hovers more around the lack of the right system and governance in the indian education industry and also has to deal with disability students' intake, progress and outgo after the education completion. the state education report for india 2019: children with disabilities by unesco states that 27% of disabled children between the age of 5-19 years don't have access to education. it also says that nearly 3/4th of 5 years old specially-abled are left out of the education system, further revealing that this ratio varies gender-wise and girls tend to show in high numbers when it comes to depriving education. as per who report, over 1 billion people in the world are specially abled contributing to 15% of the total population and whodas 2.0 accessibility standards define means of assessing the disability in an individual, which ponder on a lot of aspects such as, it has been felt that differently-abled persons need special arrangements in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning. it is also a fact that many institutes have architectural barriers that disabled persons find difficult for their day-to-day functioning. the colleges are expected to address accessibility-related issues as per the stipulations of the persons with disabilities act 1995 and ensure that all existing structures as well as future construction projects in their campuses are made disabled-friendly. the institutes should create special facilities such as ramps, rails and special toilets, and make other necessary changes to suit the special needs of differently-abled persons. the construction plans should clearly address the accessibility issues pertaining to disability. guidelines on accessibility are laid out by the office of the chief commissioner of disabilities. consciously improving education for specially-abled children will need planned efforts with the help of technology and human power. this makes the problem statement quite challenging and critical to be addressed the special compliance and governance needs. this problem statement needs holistic solutions that may be hybrid in nature. the objective of this problem statement in one way could be the right implementation of the disability act and the provisioning of digital infrastructure and applications to address the needs and feedback mechanisms. facilitate admission of differently-abled persons in various courses, provide guidance and counselling to differently-abled individuals, create awareness about the needs of differently-abled persons, and other general issues concerning their learning. assist differently-abled graduates to gain successful employment in the public as well as private sectors, designing special interaction gateways for such children and helping them feel natural while growing is important. further, the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support the intake and management of specially-abled children into the educational ecosystem. the objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solutions which may use digital and physical mediums together to make sure disabled persons are able to access and operate these applications. the solution may use technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things and blockchain to ensure specially-abled children are given the right systems to get into the mainstream of education, sustain with

SIH1502,Blended Learning to overcome inadequate infrastructure,"Once the class size passes a certain point, the teachers are bound to 'fail' because the demands on their time cannot be met. in essence, the root of this problem is not the number of children in a classroom but rather the inability for each child to receive adequate attention. combining modern technology and 1:1 tuition, students could perform far beyond other students who were being taught in more conventional ways. by combining blended learning (where face-to-face teaching is combined with online learning) with real-time data, we can get rapid feedback in classrooms and use that feedback to further enhance the quality of education. as an example, consider a classroom of 30 students. ten students with similar abilities may work closely with the teacher, another ten may work through lectures and online tasks using computer terminals, and the final ten may work together on a group project. in the next lesson, students are rotated so they can learn in different ways throughout the course. this kind of approach enables the teacher to focus more closely on fewer children at once. the teacher can also tailor the learning approach for each student based on how well each one works for the individual. meanwhile, the software on the computer is advanced enough to tailor the content to each student as well. by collecting real-time feedback on each child's results, the course contents can be adapted per student and make it as if they were receiving a one-on-one tuition. this approach allows each student to have their own learning path that's customized to their needs. by doing this, teachers can easily see which students are falling behind and offer more individualized teaching to those students. if more schools were to adopt a similar approach, where some responsibilities could be handled by tech-aided learning methods, more of the teachers' time could be freed-up to give more attention where it's needed the most, even in larger classroom sizes. further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application's that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support education delivery effectiveness of students into educational ecosystem and generate insights based on data it collected. the objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solution which may use digital and physical medium together to make sure specially abled students who are slow learners are identified, their progress is monitored and right alarms and notifications are generated to assist keeping their education on track with elevated motivation. the solution may use technologies like

SIH1505,Aerial Location of Hazardous Atmosphere in Industries,"Fire prevention is better than firefighting. with an increase in industrialization and globalisation, there has been a spate of fire accidents occurring in the past few years. every fire incident in industries causes massive losses to the assets of the nation. there are various cases of fire which caused enormous loss of property and human life, like the iocl jaipur fire in 2009, ntpc power plant explosion, unchahar in 2017, and various others. as per the national crime records bureau, over 60 people die every day in india due to fire. in iocl 2009 fire itself, the industry suffered a loss of thousands of crores. to prevent such incidents and minimize such economic losses, all industries need to have a fire pre plan which should be a part of the emergency response and disaster management plan (erdmp), and the extent of a fire hazard which includes flammability area, toxic area and threat zone calculation is instrumental in designing the fire pre-plan for any industry using areal location of hazardous atmosphere.
a comprehensive portfolio of fire pre-plans should include:
a fire pre-plan for each major storage tank and each bund area (although these can often be combined for identical tanks in a single local area).
a fire pre-plan for each pressurised storage vessel and containment area, including protection of the run-off and impounding area, and key steps to avoid a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (bleve). a fire pre-plan for refrigerated storage tanks including protection of the run-off and impounding area.
a fire pre-plan for each rail and truck loading gantry.
a fire pre-plan for each defined fire area of the unit c.g. as limited by layout/drainage where this is practical/ meaningful. at least the two or three most severe fire cases for each process unit should be defined.
any other specific cases that are equivalent to one of the above.
here, it is easily identifiable what will be the extent of thermal radiation in the case of bleve and this calculation helps design the fire pre-plan and emergency response and disaster management plan (erdmp). this calculation can be carried on regular intervals so that the fire personals are well equipped with the extent of hazards and drills can be performed considering these factors. by this calculation, we can minimize the risks and hazards that can be tackled at the very early stage, since fire personals will be aware of the situations beforehand. this can be very instrumental in reducing travel time, which is the biggest challenge.
 
situation analysis and awareness, drills and timely action are the best way to mitigate the hazard situation. hence areal location of hazardous locations shall be carried on in every industry at regular intervals so that the fire personals are well aware of the challenges, available resources and necessary precautions which are to be taken.
 
these industries are the biggest asset for our nation, especially in this era of massive industrialization. so, these preventive measures should be a part of strategic planning and technology should be used and people should be trained with this technology to save and secure the biggest gems of the nation",fire prevention better firefighting increase industrialization globalisation spate fire

the increasing vehicle numbers, primarily due to the rapid gromh in population. consequenfly, issues such as traffic congestion, narrowed streets due to on-street parking, a mismatch between parking supply and demand, and illegal parking have become all too familiar in lndian cities. parking space has become a scarce commodity, and instead of simply increasing the number of available parking spaces, it is crucial to employ effective technology-based solutions to optimize their utilization. smart parking solutions, utilizing sensors and software, can provade realtime information on available parking spaces to both city officials and drivers. furthermore, leveraging emerging technologies can help optimize parking prices. a low parking price may encourage more vehicles on the road, leading to increased air and noise pollution, whereas too high prices may generate less revenue and less efectuve resource usage.apart from the loss of revenue for operators, there is economic downside to the business in vicinity, effect on government taxes, employment.at the same parking space area and costs also have a corelation to balance optimum usage and revenue. therefore, setting the right price for parking based on demand and optimizing occupancy is the best approach. the primary objective of the solution should be to equip city administrators with an effective parking management tool that can predict, manage, and finance parking in cities. an app should be developed to allow citizens to conveniently reserve pce king spots and make payments based on dynamic pricing this not only saves citizens' time spent searching the parking but also reduces environmental degradation resulting from congestion caused by parking and provides a sustainable source of revenue for the city administration. we need an innovative, simple and widely coveraged parking needs in the city and also become most compliant for traffic and mobility needs",ln lndia number vehicles constanfly
